# 🎓 Excited to Share My Honors Data Analysis Class Final Project! 📊

Excited to unveil the culmination of my journey in my honors Data Analysis class! For my final project, I delved into the intricate world of housing affordability in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, utilizing a blend of advanced analytical techniques and cutting-edge tools.

🏠 Armed with **Python**, **Beautiful Soup**, **Pandas**, and **SQL**, I embarked on a data exploration journey like never before. Scraping housing data from zillow with Python and Beautiful Soup, I meticulously cleaned and processed the dataset using Pandas and SQL, ensuring accuracy and reliability in my analysis.

💡 With the median household income standing at $50,000 per year and the average house price towering at $307,173, I harnessed the power of data to dissect the affordability landscape. Applying the renowned "28/36 rule" as a benchmark, I calculated the affordable mortgage amount, unveiling the stark challenges faced by residents in securing affordable housing.
